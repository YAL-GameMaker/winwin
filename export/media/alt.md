An illustration of the extension's general premise, featuring a game window, an additional window with some test/debug information, and a window that looks like ðŸ‘€ emoji.

A demonstration of extension's multi-window features - a dinosaur crosses from the game window into an adjacent one, the window is moved, and the dinosaur walks back to the original window through a few more windows.

---

A demonstration of using the extension for debugging - an additional window displays the maze as it's being generated (and while the main window is busy doing the generation loop).

A demonstration of using the extension for meta-game/fourth-wall purposes - a dinosaur walks straight out of the game window, also creating a glowing grid effect under the window.
